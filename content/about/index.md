# About the Project

TerminalDawn is my ongoing project build and document truly resilient self-relient off-grid compute.

## The Mission

A fully contained renewable energy powered computing system.

## About This Site
This blog documents the engineering process, power consumption testing, and lessons learned while building TerminalDawn hardware.

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the excellent [Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) by panr, customized with a synthwave aesthetic that matches the cyberpunk nature of off-grid computing...or just my own irrational love of all things cyberpunk.
